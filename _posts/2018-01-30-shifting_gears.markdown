Six years into my career, I've decided to go back to the drawing board.  Enrolling in Flatiron School marks the beginning of my odyssey into software development.

My original career path began with my last trip through school, as an undergraduate student in Mechanical Engineering.  My major was chosen because of my affinity for math, science, and problem solving.  Perhaps foreshadowing future events, my favorite projects through college were those that involved coding simulations or algorithms in MATLAB.  After graduating, I went on to work in manufacturing for a large automotive plant.  

After 5 years, I began thinking about my next career move and the ideal changepoints for my next job.  Among the highlights - work for a smaller company, and have more freedom to work in my own style.  As I scoured through job descriptions, it became more and more apparent to that it would take a semi-drastic career change to satisfy my top requirements.  The software industry seemed to provide a fertile job market (especially with smaller companies), as well the dichotomous blend of technical thinking and free-flowing style I was seeking.

Shift back to present day, and here I am at the beginning of the Web Developer program.  I look forward to learning, problem-solving, and working in an industry where the wheels can only *figuratively* fall off.
